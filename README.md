homebrew-tap
============
This repository houses the homebrew formulas for tools I've built, such as the following:

* [bastion-pod-ctl](https://github.com/norwoodj/bastion-pod-ctl)
* [helm-docs](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs)


To install `helm-docs` for instance:
```
brew install norwoodj/tap/helm-docs
```
